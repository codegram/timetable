# timetable

Timetable is a 200-LOC script that parses structured content as YAML (for
example, sections of a course/talk you're giving or tasks you have to do)
and schedules this data from a start time. Optionally, it can give you hints
about the current task/section you're in and the next one. Man today I'm not
explaining myself well.
